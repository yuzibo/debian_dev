Please submit all non-packaging issues (feature requests, etc.) to the upstream
bug tracker first (http://www.crbug.com).  Please also include a link to your
upstream report in the Debian bug submission to make it more straightforward to
keep track of issues.  Thank you!

If you experience crashes, please read this wiki page to get a useful backtrace:
http://wiki.debian.org/Chromium/Debugging

Please, if you have apps, extensions, or plugins (like flash player) installed,
remove them temporarily to see if the problem goes away first (before submitting
your bug report).  Look at these urls to see what you currently have installed:
chrome://apps
chrome://plugins
chrome://extensions
